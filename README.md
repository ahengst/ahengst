- 👋 Hi, I’m @ahengst on github and on twitter.
- 👀 I’m interested in climate science, IoT, electronics, and CS tools I never had a chance to use in my day job as Backup & Storage Admin.
-    I also pick up garbage while riding my bike, something like "plogging" but without the jogging.
-    I volunteer with LibreOffice (bug triage) when I feel like it.
-    
- 🌱 Dec 2022: I’m currently learning to get comfortable with git & github
